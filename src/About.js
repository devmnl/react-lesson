        <p>
          Hello! I'm Manoel Franco, a software engineer passionate about creating dynamic web applications.
          With expertise in JavaScript, React, and various backend technologies, I love turning ideas into reality
          through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in tech started with a fascination for how software can solve real-world problems. 
          I enjoy collaborating with teams and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar or enjoying some time outdoors.
